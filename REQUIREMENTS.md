More questions than answers here
? should we allow applications directly or collect them and send on to the company email
? if we are collecting emails, should we require a signup
  i am thinking we go with collecting
    - Name
    - Email
    - CV
    - Cover Letter
  
  I don't want signups yet because of the overhead also meaning we need to manage stuff like profiles
  Too much scope creep if you ask me
  I am generally in favor of standardizing the application process, but would prefer something like sending 
  you an email per application for you to confirm before we send the email to the company.
  The only inconvenience I see here is subsequent applications but that since we aren't managing profiles....
  then again the issue of always uploading your stuff. infinite loop coming up.... help!
